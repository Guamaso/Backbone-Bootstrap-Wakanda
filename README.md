Backbone-Bootstrap-Wakanda
==========================

Paid Time Off Web and Mobile App using Backbone and  Bootstrap with Wakanda Server.

Wakanda is an open-source platform that allows you to develop single page business web applications. It provides a unified stack running on JavaScript from end-to-end. The platform is comprised of:

Wakanda Server
Wakanda Studio
Wakanda Client Framework

For this project I replaced the Wakanda Client Framwork with Backbone and Bootstrap. I modified Backbone to use the Wakanda Server rest api.

If you want to give it a try there are two applications :

A  [User application](http://192.241.155.204:8081).

And an [Admin application](http://192.241.155.204:8081/admin.html).

Here is a list of some of the username/passwords you can use to login the main application. You can use the admin application to set the role of the user and assign them PTO hours.

    greg@wakanda.org/wakanda1

    dave@wakanda.org/wakanda1

    tom@wakanda.org/wakanda1

    court@wakanda.org/wakanda1

    tracy@wakanda.org/wakanda1



Here is a username/password for the admin application:

    sanda@wakanda.org/wakanda1
