Backbone-Bootstrap-Wakanda
==========================

Paid Time Off Web and Mobile App using Backbone and  Bootstrap with Wakanda Server.

Wakanda is an open-source platform that allows you to develop single page business web applications. It provides a unified stack running on JavaScript from end-to-end. The platform is comprised of:

Wakanda Server

Wakanda Studio

Wakanda Client Framework

For this project I replaced the Wakanda Client Framwork with Backbone and Bootstrap. I modified Backbone to use the Wakanda Server rest api.
